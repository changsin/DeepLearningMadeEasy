# Deep Learning Made Easy
The resources in this repository are easy ways to learn Deep Learning.
Math and coding are two biggest hurdles to Deep Learning.
Fortunately, there are many no-code or low-code tools that
you can use to jump start your learning journey.
Here is the compilation of the tools.

# Teachable Machine Learning
[Teachable Machine Learning](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
is a model training platform developed by Google.
With a few clicks, you can train a model and can deploy to your device or web site.
Image, Audio, and Pose are the three supported project type right now,
but there might be more in the future.

## Pros
- Intuitive and easy to use
- Can deploy easily to an edge device or a website
- TensorFlowJS code sample is automatically generated

## Cons
- Can only do classification for images
- Object detection is not supported yet
- Hard to customize for your own needs

# Peltarion
[Peltarion](https://peltarion.com/) is another easy-to-use
low code AI learning tool. It is a more advanced tool compared to
Google's Teachable ML, but you have more options to choose and customize.

## Pros:
- A lot of sample projects and datasets you can use to jump start.
- Tutorials and other learning materials available.
- More options to choose from and customize according to your own needs.

## Cons:
- The menus are more complex and require some time to be familiar
- Compute time and Storage are limited for a free account.

# Traffic Counting
[Deep Learning for Traffic Counting](https://github.com/changsin/DLTrafficCounter)
is inspired by the chicken activity monitor from
Joy Institute of Technology's [AI Camp](https://github.com/joyinstech/aicamp).
You can supply your own video stream of cars to test it.
